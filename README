MultiAgentDecisionProcess (MADP) is a toolbox for scientific research
in decision-theoretic planning and learning in multiagent systems.  It
is designed to be rather general, but most effort has been put in
planning algorithms for discrete Dec-POMDPs.

Comments, bug reports, patches, etc, are welcome. A mailinglist is
available at madp-users@isr.ist.utl.pt .

========================================================================
Required software:

MADP includes all required software.

Optional software (Debian package names):

Doxygen (doxygen) [for generating documentation]
Graphviz (graphviz) [for dependency graphs in the generated documentation]
lp-solve (liblpsolve55-dev and libufsparse-dev) [for alpha vector pruning]
libxml2 (libxml2-dev) [for using the XML-based factored model parser]

cplex [for the DP-LPC solver]

For enabling optional software, see src/Makefile.custom and
src/include/configuration.h.

========================================================================
Documentation and Installation Instructions

See doc/MADPToolbox-0.XXX.pdf, which also includes detailed 
installation instructions.

To (re)generate API documentation from source, run:

make htmldoc

Open doc/html/index.html in a webbrowser

To compile, Execute the following
./configure [OPTIONS]
make
make install (optional)

A typical options for configure is '--prefix=$HOME' if you need to install in 
your local directory. Also, if you need CPLEX, you may need to specify the
locations. E.g.:

CPLEX_LOCATION=/opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio125
CPLEX_STRING="\
    --with-cplex-includes=\"$INCLUDE -I$CPLEX_LOCATION/cplex/include/ -I$CPLEX_LOCATION/concert/include/\"  \
    --with-cplex-libs=\"-lilocplex -lconcert -lcplex \" \
    --with-cplex-ldflags=\"-L$CPLEX_LOCATION/cplex/lib/x86-64_sles10_4.1/static_pic -L$CPLEX_LOCATION/concert/lib/x86-64_sles10_4.1/static_pic\" \
"
./configure $CPLEX_STRING

For all options, please use:
./configure --help


Problem descriptions can be loaded without specifying a path if
~/.madp/problems is a symlink to the problems subdir in the MADP tree.
Similarly, results are saved in (subdirs of) ~/.madp/results, so will
be convenient to make a symlink to the desired results locations.
This can be accomplished as follows:

mkdir ~/.madp
cd ~/.madp
ln -s ~/<PATHTOMADP>/problems
ln -s ~/<PATHTOMADP>/results
