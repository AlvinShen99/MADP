MultiAgentDecisionProcess (MADP) is a toolbox for scientific research
in decision-theoretic planning and learning in multiagent systems.  It
is designed to be rather general, but most effort has been put in
planning algorithms for discrete Dec-POMDPs.

Comments, bug reports, patches, etc, are welcome. A mailinglist is
available at madp-users@isr.ist.utl.pt .
