MultiAgentDecisionProcess (MADP) is a toolbox for scientific research
in decision-theoretic planning and learning in multiagent systems.  It
is designed to be rather general, but most effort has been put in
planning algorithms for discrete Dec-POMDPs.

Comments, bug reports, patches, etc, are welcome. A mailinglist is
available at madp-users@isr.ist.utl.pt .

========================================================================
Installation:

Execute the following

sh autogen.sh
./configure
make

Problem descriptions can be loaded without specifying a path if
~/.madp/problems is a symlink to the problems subdir in the MADP tree.
Similarly, results are saved in (subdirs of) ~/.madp/results, so will
be convenient to make a symlink to the desired results locations.
This can be accomplished as follows:

mkdir ~/.madp
cd ~/.madp
ln -s ~/<PATHTOMADP>/problems
ln -s ~/<PATHTOMADP>/results

========================================================================
Documentation:

To generate documentation from source
